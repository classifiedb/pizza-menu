/**
 * PASSING AND RECEIVING PROPS (prop = property)
 * Props - is the way of passing data between components (from parent to child components)
 * You can pass anything as a prop, it's not just a number or string it could be arrays
 *
 * 2 ways to define props
 * 1- pass props into the component
 * 2- receive the prop into the component we passed into
 *
 * props, immutability, and one-way data flow
 * - props are used to pass data from parent components to child components (down the component tree)
 * - Essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters)
 * - with props, parent components control how child components look and work
 * - Anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components
 *
 * (props are read-only) they are immutable!  this is one of react's strict rule (if you need to mutate props, you actually need state)
 *  - because props are objects, and when changes happen to the child they will affect the parent as well.
 *  - Mutating props would affect parent, creating side effects (not pure) (never mutate any date outside of it's function scope)
 *  - Components have to be pure functions in terms of props and state
 *  - This allows React to optimize apps, avoid bugs, make apps preddictable
 *
 * Props is data coming from the outside, and can only be updated by the parent component
 * state is internal data that can be updated by the component's logic

/**

 *    - Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement function call
 *    - we could actually use React without JSX
 *
 * JSX is DECLARATIVE: - Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data
 *              - React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM
 *              - Instead, we think of the UI as a reflection of the current data
 *              (basically we tell React what we want on the screen, but not how)
 *
 * IMPERATIVE: manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing
 *          - Step-by-step DOM mutations until we reach the desired UI
 *            (vanilla react, basically tell react how to do things step by step)

/**
 * RULES OF JSX
 * GENERAL JSX RULES: JSX works essentially like HTML, but we can enter "JavaScript mode" by using {} (for text or attributes)
 * - we can place JavaScript expression inside {}. Eg. reference variables, create arrays or objects [].map(), ternary operator
 * - Statement are not allowed (if/else, for, switch)
 * - JSX produces a JavaScript expression (the ones below are the same thing)
 *      const el = <h1>Hello React!</h1>
 *      const el = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello React!");
 *      1. we can place other pieces of JSX inside {}
 *      2. we can write JSX anywhere inside a component (in if/else, assign to variables, pass it into functions)
 * - A piece of JSX can only have one root element. if you need more, use <React.Fragment> (or the short <>)
 *
 * DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REACT JSX AND HTML5
 * - className instead of HTML's class
 * - htmlFor instead of HTML's for
 * - Every tag needs to be closed. Eg. <img /> or <br />
 * - All event handlers and other properties need to be camelCased. Eg. onClick or onMouseOver
 * - Exception: aria-* and data-* are written with dashes like in HTML
 * - CSS inline styles are written like this: {{<style}} (to reference a variable, and then an object)
 * - CSS property names are also camelCased
 * - Comments need to be in {} (because they are JS)

/**
 * SUMMARY
 * - JSX block is what we return from a component
 *
 * Component contatins -->Data --> JS Logic --> Appearance: JSX (HTML, CSS, JS inside {})
 *
 * Parents components can pass data to direct child component using props
 * - props can only be passed from parents to children and not the other way
 *
 * Rendering multiple components at once using the JavaScript .map() method
 * - components can be conditionally rendered using JS tools: &&, ?, and multiple return
